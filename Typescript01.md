## What is a trasnpiler?

Transpiler is read a source written in one programming language, and produce the equivalent code in other language.

## Basic

### Static Type-Cheking

That's what a static type-cheker type TypeScript does. **Static types system describe the shapes and behaviors of what our values will be**1 when we run our programs. A type-checker like TypeScript uses that information and tells us when things might be **going off the rails**.

### Non-exception Failures

Static type-system has to make the call over what code should be flagged as an error in its system, even if it's **valid** Javascript that won't immediately throw an error.
